Please be as accurate as possible. Using understandable English also
helps:)

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Creating a new short url
2. The new url works, but is a sequential number: 1, 2, 3 and so on.
3.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I thought I would see a short, random url. Is there a setting that produces
a random set of charcters? The sequential numbers would cause privacy
issues, I would think.

Please write in your current versions of YOURLS, PHP, OS, Browser if
applicable, etc...
Running 1.3-RC1 on PHP 5 and Apache. I'm using Firefox on Windows XP.


Please provide any additional information below.

There's no setting that produce a random set of characters. And creating random
string would not do anything with privacy (you can just fetch any urls from a to
zzzzzzzzzz)

You could make a script yourself that would create a random string then use it as a
custom keyword then send it to YOURLS via the API.

I think the issue here may be the YOURLS homepage has the following: 

"Random (sequential) or custom URL keyword"

Sequential doesn't mean random...

I, too, would love a 'random string generator' for the YOURLS.

Agreed on the wording, I'm removing "random" from the readme.

I won't make a random url stuff though.

It's easy to implement ....
If string keyword is empty, then string keyword=random characters and it's done...

I'm trying to do it right now....

In case someone is following this issue: YOURLS 1.5 will have a super cool plugin architecture allowing to implement practically any feature you'll miss, like for instance https://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/PluginRandomKeywords

Don't hack core files because you will lose your changes next time you upgrade. Use plugins instead.

it's very easy to get your url in random string...
just replace the code start at line 286 :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create random keyword	
		} else {
			$timestamp = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
			$id = yourls_get_next_decimal();
			$ok = false;
			do {
				$keyword = yourls_int2string( $id );
				$free = yourls_keyword_is_free($keyword);
				$add_url = @yourls_insert_link_in_db($url, $keyword);
				$ok = ($free && $add_url);
				if ( $ok === false && $add_url === 1 ) {
					// we stored something, but shouldn't have (ie reserved id)
					$delete = yourls_delete_link_by_keyword( $keyword );
					$return['extra_info'] .= '(deleted '.$keyword.')';
				} else {
					// everything ok, populate needed vars
					$return['url'] = array('keyword' => $keyword, 'url' => $strip_url, 'date' => $timestamp, 'ip' => $ip );
					$return['status'] = 'success';
					$return['message'] = $strip_url.' added to database';
					$return['html'] = yourls_table_add_row( $keyword, $url, $ip, 0, time() );
					$return['shorturl'] = YOURLS_SITE .'/'. $keyword;
				}
				$id++;
			} while (!$ok);
			@yourls_update_next_decimal($id);
		}
====================================================================================

with this one:

====================================================================================
// Create random keyword
		} else {
			$timestamp = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
			$chars = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
			// You can modify it whatever you want. You may replace it with
			// '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWZYZ'
			// to enable case-sensitive random string.
			$rand_length = 5; // Define the random string length
			$keyword = substr(str_shuffle($chars),0,$rand_length);
// Modified by http://twitter.com/dimassony
// Use at your own risk!
			$ok = false;
			do {
				$free = yourls_keyword_is_free($keyword);
				$add_url = @yourls_insert_link_in_db($url, $keyword);
				$ok = ($free && $add_url);
				if ( $ok === false && $add_url === 1 ) {
					// we stored something, but shouldn't have (ie reserved id)
					$delete = yourls_delete_link_by_keyword( $keyword );
					$return['extra_info'] .= '(deleted '.$keyword.')';
				} else {
					// everything ok, populate needed vars
					$return['url'] = array('keyword' => $keyword, 'url' => $strip_url, 'date' => $timestamp, 'ip' => $ip );
					$return['status'] = 'success';
					$return['message'] = $strip_url.' added to database';
					$return['html'] = yourls_table_add_row( $keyword, $url, $ip, 0, time() );
					$return['shorturl'] = YOURLS_SITE .'/'. $keyword;
				}
			} while (!$ok);
		}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It will generate 5 characters random string. When you need to set the length of the random string, just modify the $rand_length value. And you can modify the random characters may contains by change $chars value.

I attached the modified version for easier use :)

Dimas, that works very well and is simple enough for me to read and understand. Thank you very much.

Used the above code and worked like a charm -- thanks!

Thanks for the patch, I am applying it now.

Yourls is great but I was disappointed to find that the generated links were sequential starting at 1. 

This patch makes Yourls really useful and professional.

You're doing it wrong. There's a plugin to generate random URLs.

Just tried this with Yourls 1.5 and it works perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for :)

Thanks so much @dimassony!

I used Oz's RandomKeyword Plugin, https://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/PluginRandomKeywords
Everything is ok. Thx Oz, really good work.
