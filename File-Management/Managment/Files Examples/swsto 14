Welcome to URL Generator for Windows 9x/2k/NT/Me/XP

URL Generator is an utility designed specifically to assist Rafabot users who need to download a large sequence of files from a server that does not reveal file listings, but where you know the file naming conventions used on the that server.

In particular, it is designed for 'directly downloadable files', where you do not want to download whole websites, or HTML files, but perhaps a range of sequential images from an online image library. Perhaps you subscribe to an image library where you have to add files to a basket, but the basket does not have a "bulk" or "download all" option - you have to  download each file individually! That could take days when you have a large library!

URL Generator will create a list of URL's based on the field values you enter. The list of URL's can then be saved from the program, and loaded into RAFABOT (General tab / Source: URLs from File). RAFABOT will then download each and every file automatically, and saves you having to manually type in each file you want to download.

Please see below the version information for tips on how to use this program effectively.
