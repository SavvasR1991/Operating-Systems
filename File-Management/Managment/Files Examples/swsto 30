Why use the mobile version or at least a simpler version of a web site when Maemo devices are capable of accessing the full version? Some reasons:

    Speed -- simpler versions may be considerably faster because they lack Flash and JavaScript. Full versions of websites are sometimes designed to run on desktop processors using browsers with JavaScript optimizations.
    Focus -- simpler versions are often to the point, more in keeping with the spirit of mobile apps vs. desktop apps.
    Compatibility -- sometimes the full version of a web site doesn't support Maemo devices properly. 

On talk.maemo.org, there are periodic requests for mobile versions of sites.
