How to auto-generate random URLs in PW? For example when we upload images on Tumblr, an URL to the post is created with a random number "95032257420":

 

http://twotimesellio...ost/95032257420  

 

And an URL for the image is created:

 

http://31.media.tumb.6ky2bo1_500.jpg

 

How can we do that in PW?

Why would you want that?

 

Btw.: Why not just using $page->id ?

As mentioned before, modules.processwire.com/modules/process-field-generator/ is a module I made that does exactly that. Reason why I personally needed it : the ID of content had to not be discoverable and a fixed length. Page IDs don't provide that.
