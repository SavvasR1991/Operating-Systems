+Farid Cedeno That could be the case agreed, but I dont think Isco would let loose his place so easy, Isco has impressed Carlo and Carlo know what a quality player he has in his disposal. James & Isco can play together, and honestly if i were carlo i would rather bench bale at the moment and play 442 with isco and james. But him leaving for barca its impossible, there wont be any direct transfers between RM & Barca anymore, they both learned from the past transfers they did direct especially barca for losing Figo when he was their idol at the time and became a RMadrid Legend.
